// At first you have to create a new Rust project using "cargo init" in the terminal.
// Then you can replace the contents of src/main.rs with the code you want.
// Officially you run the project with "cargo run" in the terminal. But for me, I run the Code with CTRL+ALT+N in my editor (uses CodeRunner extension).

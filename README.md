# Rust-Learning
My progress of learning Rust.
Website used: https://www.w3schools.com/rust/

At first you have to create a new Rust project using "cargo init" or "cargo new 'project_name' in the terminal.
Then you can replace the contents of src/main.rs with the code you want.
Officially you run the project with "cargo run" in the terminal. But for me, I run the Code with CTRL+ALT+N in my editor (uses CodeRunner extension).
